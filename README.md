## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Factorize all the things!**
Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.

- Usage: factors <file>
    - where <file> is a file containing natural numbers to factor.
    - One number per line
    - You can assume that all lines will be valid natural numbers greater than 1
    - You can assume that there will be no empy line, and no space before and after the valid number
    - The file will always end with a new line
- Output format: n=p*q
    - one factorization per line
    - p and q don’t have to be prime numbers
    - See example
- You can work on the numbers of the file in the order of your choice
- Your program should run without any dependency: You will not be able to install anything on the machine we will run your program on
- Time limit: Your program will be killed after 5 seconds if it hasn’t finish
- Push all your scripts, source code, etc… to your repository
    - we will only run your executable factors

* **1. RSA Factoring Challenge**
RSA Laboratories states that: for each RSA number `n`, there exist prime numbers `p` and `q` such that

`n = p × q`. The problem is to find these two primes, given only `n`.

This task is the same as task 0, except:
- p and q are always prime numbers
- There is only one number in the files
How far can you go in less than 5 seconds?
